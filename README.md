# Homework2

index.html

Contains picture of me as well as a little bio.

portfolio.html

Contains pictures and labels for projects

contact.html

Contains Name, Email, and message forms and submit button

All pages have Nav header and footer. Nav header has collapsible bar changing "About Porfolio Contact" into 3 bars that drops down. Project contains Raleway and Sulphur Point for fonts. I didn't create a CSS file because originally I wanted to see if I would be able to make a strictly bootstrap website. I thought it was boring so I added styles within my HTML.
